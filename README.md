pre-commit-hooks
==========

Some out-of-the-box hooks for pre-commit.

### Using pre-commit-hooks with pre-commit

Add this to your `.pre-commit-config.yaml`

    -   repo: https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit-hooks
        rev: v1.3.0  # Use the ref you want to point at
        hooks:
        -   id: trailing-whitespace
        # -   id: ...


### Hooks available

- `autopep8-wrapper` - Runs autopep8 over python source.
    - Ignore PEP 8 violation types with `args: ['-i', '--ignore=E000,...']` or
      through configuration of the `[pycodestyle]` section in
      setup.cfg / tox.ini.
- `check-added-large-files` - Prevent giant files from being committed.
    - Specify what is "too large" with `args: ['--maxkb=123']` (default=500kB).
    - If `git-lfs` is installed, lfs files will be skipped
      (requires `git-lfs>=2.2.1`)
- `check-ast` - Simply check whether files parse as valid python.
- `check-builtin-literals` - Require literal syntax when initializing empty or zero Python builtin types.
    - Allows calling constructors with positional arguments (e.g., `list('abc')`).
    - Allows calling constructors from the `builtins` (`__builtin__`) namespace (`builtins.list()`).
    - Ignore this requirement for specific builtin types with `--ignore=type1,type2,â€¦`.
    - Forbid `dict` keyword syntax with `--no-allow-dict-kwargs`.
- `check-byte-order-marker` - Forbid files which have a UTF-8 byte-order marker
- `check-case-conflict` - Check for files with names that would conflict on a
  case-insensitive filesystem like MacOS HFS+ or Windows FAT.
- `check-docstring-first` - Checks for a common error of placing code before
  the docstring.
- `check-executables-have-shebangs` - Checks that non-binary executables have a
  proper shebang.
- `check-json` - Attempts to load all json files to verify syntax.
- `check-merge-conflict` - Check for files that contain merge conflict strings.
- `check-symlinks` - Checks for symlinks which do not point to anything.
- `check-vcs-permalinks` - Ensures that links to vcs websites are permalinks.
- `check-xml` - Attempts to load all xml files to verify syntax.
- `check-yaml` - Attempts to load all yaml files to verify syntax.
    - `--allow-multiple-documents` - allow yaml files which use the
      [multi-document syntax](http://www.yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html#YAML)
    - `--unsafe` - Instead of loading the files, simply parse them for syntax.
      A syntax-only check enables extensions and unsafe constructs which would
      otherwise be forbidden.  Using this option removes all guarantees of
      portability to other yaml implementations.
      Implies `--allow-multiple-documents`.
- `debug-statements` - Check for debugger imports and py37+ `breakpoint()`
  calls in python source.
- `detect-aws-credentials` - Checks for the existence of AWS secrets that you
  have set up with the AWS CLI.
  The following arguments are available:
  - `--credentials-file` - additional AWS CLI style configuration file in a
    non-standard location to fetch configured credentials from. Can be repeated
    multiple times.
- `detect-private-key` - Checks for the existence of private keys.
- `double-quote-string-fixer` - This hook replaces double quoted strings
  with single quoted strings.
- `end-of-file-fixer` - Makes sure files end in a newline and only a newline.
- `fix-encoding-pragma` - Add `# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-` to the top of python files.
    - To remove the coding pragma pass `--remove` (useful in a python3-only codebase)
- `file-contents-sorter` - Sort the lines in specified files (defaults to alphabetical). You must provide list of target files as input to it. Note that this hook WILL remove blank lines and does NOT respect any comments.
- `flake8` - Run flake8 on your python files.
- `forbid-new-submodules` - Prevent addition of new git submodules.
- `mixed-line-ending` - Replaces or checks mixed line ending.
    - `--fix={auto,crlf,lf,no}`
        - `auto` - Replaces automatically the most frequent line ending. This is the default argument.
        - `crlf`, `lf` - Forces to replace line ending by respectively CRLF and LF.
        - `no` - Checks if there is any mixed line ending without modifying any file.
- `name-tests-test` - Assert that files in tests/ end in `_test.py`.
    - Use `args: ['--django']` to match `test*.py` instead.
- `no-commit-to-branch` - Protect specific branches from direct checkins.
    - Use `args: [--branch <branch>]` to set the branch. `master` is the
      default if no argument is set.
    - `-b` / `--branch` may be specified multiple times to protect multiple
      branches.
- `pyflakes` - Run pyflakes on your python files.
- `pretty-format-json` - Checks that all your JSON files are pretty.  "Pretty"
  here means that keys are sorted and indented.  You can configure this with
  the following commandline options:
    - `--autofix` - automatically format json files
    - `--indent ...` - Control the indentation (either a number for a number of spaces or a string of whitespace).  Defaults to 4 spaces.
    - `--no-sort-keys` - when autofixing, retain the original key ordering (instead of sorting the keys)
    - `--top-keys comma,separated,keys` - Keys to keep at the top of mappings.
- `requirements-txt-fixer` - Sorts entries in requirements.txt and removes incorrect entry for `pkg-resources==0.0.0`
- `sort-simple-yaml` - Sorts simple YAML files which consist only of top-level keys, preserving comments and blocks.
- `trailing-whitespace` - Trims trailing whitespace.
    - Markdown linebreak trailing spaces preserved for `.md` and`.markdown`;
      use `args: ['--markdown-linebreak-ext=txt,text']` to add other extensions,
      `args: ['--markdown-linebreak-ext=*']` to preserve them for all files,
      or `args: ['--no-markdown-linebreak-ext']` to disable and always trim.

### As a standalone package

If you'd like to use these hooks, they're also available as a standalone
package.
