In order to run automatic tests and know test coverage, following commands are suggested (notice that will run
ALL pre_commit_hooks tests, not only Loaderon's):

coverage erase
coverage run --source pre_commit_hooks -m pytest
coverage report --fail-under 100

Each automatic test method should have three stages:
-Initialization: declaring and specification of all necessary variables and data for the test.
-Execution: run all to-be-tested procedures.
-Restoration: Eventual undoing of actions that may have changed external configurations. So as to ensure unit testing
isolation. Restoration should go before verification in case test fails.
-Verification: checking of obtained results. Might not be necessary when an exception is expected.
