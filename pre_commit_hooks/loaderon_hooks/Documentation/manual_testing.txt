Inside pre_commit_hooks/loaderon_hooks/tests/manual_testing you can find several finds which function is to allow
quick manual testing of any developed hook.

runner.py is in charge of calling the main function of any hook file, and thus trigger that hook by passing
a to-be-tested file as parameter. The hook will take that file and run it's checks, potentially allowing us to debug
and therefore find possible problems.

testing_class.py is a to-be-tested file example, used to test check_class_docstring hook.

testing_view.xml is a to-be-tested file example, used to test check_view_name Odoo specific hook.
